This project is a deep learning-based face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It classifies images into two categories:
- With Mask 😷
- Without Mask 😐

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The model is trained on a dataset of face images to detect whether the person is wearing a mask or not. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the CNN model, and includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and performance evaluation.
